# Video Project Template

Basic template for video projects

## Folder Structure

Video Project Template (VPT) adheres to best practices for folder conventions:

- **/Project** - Premiere and After Effects projects
- **/Footage** - video footage
- **/Assets** - Photoshop files, titles, stock footage, B-roll, etc
- **/Audio**
	- **/Music** - background music
	- **/Voiceover** - narration
	- (sound effects would go here, too)
- **/Output** - final renders
