# Video Project Template

Basic template for video projects

## Folder Structure

Video Project Template (VPT) adheres to best practices for folder conventions:

- **/Project** - Premiere and After Effects projects
- **/Footage** - video footage
- **/Assets** - Photoshop files, titles, stock footage, B-roll, etc
- **/Audio**
	- **/Music** - background music
	- **/Voiceover** - narration
	- (sound effects would go here, too)
- **/Output** - final renders

## Filename Guide

[Scene]-[Person]-[Take]-[Camera].mov

A few examples (A/B/C are different scenes):

- A-Winnie-tk3.mov
- B-Tim-tk2-cam1.mov

### What to do if you're using an outdated version of Premiere

Open the .prproj file in *TextEdit*, change the software version to the version of your choice (e.g.: CS6, CS5.5). Save and close, then reopen in Premiere.

**Update (11/13/13)**: This doesn't seem to work with CC...
