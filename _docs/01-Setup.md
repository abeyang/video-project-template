# First Ten Yards: Setting Up

Using this project template for video projects

## Folder Structure

Video Project Template (VPT) adheres to best practices for folder conventions:

- **/Assets** - Photoshop files, titles, stock footage, B-roll, etc
- **/Audio**
	- **/Music** - background music
	- **/Voiceover** - narration
	- (sound effects would go here, too)
- **/Footage** - video footage
- **/Output** - final renders
- **/Project** - Premiere and After Effects projects
- **/VFX** - For After Effects (and other VFX-related) projects

## Filename Guide

[Scene]-[Person]-[Take]-[Camera].mov

A few examples (A/B/C are different scenes):

- A-Winnie-tk3.mov
- B-Tim-tk2-cam1.mov

## Project Structure

Similar to the folder structure, with minor differences (highlighted below)

- ASSETS
	- Titles - for text and title layers
	- VFX - VFX outputs would go here (to be used within the video project)
- AUDIO
	- Background Music
- FOOTAGE - original footage
- MERGED SEQUENCES - when original DSLR footage is combined with pristine audio, those clips would go here
- PROJECT
	- Backups - always good to back up!

Under **PROJECT**, there is a blank sequence template for you to use (set at 1080p, 23.976 fps).
